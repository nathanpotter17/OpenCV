Python OpenCV Practice

My journey learning OpenCV with Python has been truly interesting. It's an exploration into image processing and computer vision, all within the Python environment. 
OpenCV, the open-source library, provides access to tutorials, communities, and documentation, making it suitable for all skill levels. Throughout my learning, I've 
grasped techniques for loading, processing, and saving images, applying filters, detecting objects, and tracking motion. As I progressed, I delved into more complex 
projects, such as autonomous vehicles and medical image analysis. This experience unlocks various exciting opportunities in the expanding realm of computer vision.
