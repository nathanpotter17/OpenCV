# Python OpenCV Practice

This Repositority is an exploration into image processing and computer vision using OpenCV with Python. 
OpenCV, the open-source library, provides access to tutorials, communities, and documentation, making it suitable for all skill levels. Throughout my learning, I've 
grasped techniques for loading, processing, and saving images, applying filters, detecting objects, and tracking motion. As I progress, I will update this repository with more complex 
projects, such as universal scene description. 💻 👁️ 🔤
